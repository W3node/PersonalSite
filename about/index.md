## Certifications & Licences

The reality is technologies are changing at a rapide pace, aquiring the proper skills by following courses is part of my weekly schedule. Having followed hundred of MOOC courses in addition to university courses, is part of accrediting you have the appropriate professional knowledge to start executing. Please refer to [accreditations] (https://guillaumelauzier.com/accreditations) section for certifications, licences and badges.

## Coding Awards

Courses are great to have the appropriate understanding of technologies, on the other hand coding demands practice by doing problem solving exercices, sites like TopCoder CodeByte HackerRank CodeWars Leetcode amongst others offer coding challenges to get better.
