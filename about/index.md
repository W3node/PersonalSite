I'm a full stack developer and entrepreneur working with a diversity of web technologies including web3 and developing iOS applications. I launched my 1st retail business at age 17 in Switzerland called Rolling Blaze and have been accumlating the tech ventures since, I also collaborated with and founded several other web startups which I'm pround of. I am based in Geneva, Switzerland interested in working on blockchain solutions and open to other challenges as well. You'll find projects I'm currently working on in [Collaboration](https://guillaumelauzier.com/collaboration) that I either need a hand for from investing to developing, or can give a hand for as a consultant and developer.

If you're interested in reading documentation about different apps and projects I've worked on, check out [Blog](https://guillaumelauzier.com/blog) section. You can browse the technology I used in the [Tags](https://guillaumelauzier.com/tags), and sort based on your area of interest.


## Certifications & Licences

The reality is technologies are changing at a rapide pace, acquiring the proper skills by following courses is part of my weekly schedule. Having followed hundred of MOOC courses in addition to university courses, is part of accrediting you have the appropriate professional knowledge to start executing. Please refer to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16wFJobrMlWcASuzTC4sHIJJKZxnhS6wU?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive Folder</a> for certifications, licences and badges.

## Coding Awards

Courses are great to have the appropriate understanding of technologies, on the other hand coding demands practice by doing problem solving exercices, sites like TopCoder CodeByte HackerRank CodeWars Leetcode amongst others offer coding challenges to get better.
