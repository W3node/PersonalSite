## Certifications, Licences and Badges

The reality is technologies are changing at a rapide pace, keeping up abd learning by following courses is part of my weekly schedule. Having followed hundred of MOOC courses in addition to university courses, is part of accrediting you have the appropriate professional knowledge to start executing. Please refer to [accreditations] (https://guillaumelauzier.com/accreditations) section for certifications.

## Coding Awards

Jekyll Metro is the result of wanting a clean and new theme for my personal site. I was initially inspired by the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde). but soon I was googling to see if there are any Metro inspired theme available.
Since, I couldn't find one, I decided to built one for myself. One of the main goal of building my own theme was to have a modern responsive theme that looks good on mobile, tablet and desktop.

You are free to use or fork this theme. And any contribution to fixes of issues are welcome.
