I'm a full stack developer and entrepreneur working with a diversity of web technologies including web3 and developing iOS applications. I launched my 1st retail business at 17 in Switzerland called Rolling Blaze and have been accumulating the tech ventures since then. I also collaborated with and founded several other web startups which has strenghten my experience of trial&error. I am based in Geneva, Switzerland and interested in working on blockchain solutions, I'm also open to other challenges as well.

## Certifications & Licences

The reality is technologies are changing at a rapide pace, acquiring the proper skills by following courses is part of my weekly schedule. Having followed hundred of MOOC courses in addition to university courses, is part of accrediting you have the appropriate professional knowledge to start executing. Please refer to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16wFJobrMlWcASuzTC4sHIJJKZxnhS6wU?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive Folder</a> for certifications, licences and badges.

## Coding Awards

Courses are great to have the appropriate understanding of technologies, on the other hand coding demands practice by doing problem solving exercices, sites like TopCoder CodeByte HackerRank CodeWars Leetcode amongst others offer coding challenges to get better.
